# 1) Python 3 Port Scanner

This Python 3 script is a simple port scanner that allows you to scan a range of ports on a specified IP address. The script was created as part of a project to gain hands-on experience in using Python for
real-world cybersecurity tasks. The original script was built by the course instructor (HackerSploit) and it is based on the "socket" module to provide basic port scanning functionality. As part of the 
project, I included small features and made a few tweaks such as port range, logo, platform compatibility, and error handling to the script to improve its functionality and usability.
 
## Usage

I tested the script on Kali linux VM and Windows Server 2019 VM, and worked perfectly fine on both Operating Systems.

To use the Port Scanner on Kali, simply run "sudo chmod +x PortScanner.py" then run "sudo python3 PortScanner.py". The script will prompt you to enter an IP address and a port range to scan. 
Once you have entered the required information, the script will scan the specified range of ports and output a message indicating whether each port is open or closed.

On Windows, run "PortScanner.py" or ".\PortScanner.py" in cmd. Disable Windows defender and firewall incase of Windows security measures that might prevent the script from being executed.

Port range format: x-y (ex: 80-100)
